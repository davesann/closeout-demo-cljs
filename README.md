# closeout-demos-cljs

Closeout demo applications

In action here: http://closeout-demo.herokuapp.com/

If it's slow to start - it probably means that the instance has to boot up.


# How to build

git clone
lein deps

use your cljs-build tool of choice. 
Provided it includes jars in lib.

# Documentation

Pending - some of the files are annotated and the examples go from simple to 
complex as:

* clock
* clock2
* stopwatch
* todos
